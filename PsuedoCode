Need to do:
Read in a zobj file (hex)
Ask user for the display list to export (extract?)
Copy the display list to a new zobj
  From start to DF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Get the vector data
Find all cases of 01 at an offset % f = 0 or % 8 = 0
  Get all 8 bits
  Grab all the data from the first offset to the (last offset + last length - 1)
  Paste into zobj
  Change the 01 offsets to the end of the zobj file plus each 01s length
Get the texture data
Find all cases of FD
  Use the utility somehow?
  Or tell user to run the utility and have the offsets/lengths ready
  Ask user to give texture lengths for each offset
Paste the texuture data into the zobj
Change the offsets to be the end of the vector data plus all lengths of textures
